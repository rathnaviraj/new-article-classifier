Dialog is heavily investing in expanding infrastructure for data business, while increasing its ‘infortainment’ segment, which is the next key driver of growth, officials said.
Apart from the expansion of the multifaceted ICT infrastructures of the Dialog Group, including 4G and 3G high speed broadband, fibre optic, fixed telecommunication and international telecommunication networks, the company has purchased the famous ThePapare.com domain.
“ThePapare.com is a pioneer of live streaming of sport in Sri Lanka and has an average of 200,000 hits a month and a daily ballooning facebook membership which stands at over 43,000. Since we do many sports sponsorships, this was a good fit,” a senior official told the Business Times. Analysts say in the next five years in a market with smart phone penetration of 6 per cent, the recently introduced Dialog smartphone range under the in house brand at affordable prices would also contribute towards the ‘non voice’ growth in the company.
Dialog showcased 11.6 percent year on year revenue growth recording Rs. 16, 124.6 million for the quarter and 13.6 percent year on year in 1-3Q13 underpinned by growth across all segments. Dialog mobile subscriber base stood at 8.5 million as at end 3Q13 expanding 234,000 additions during the quarter.
International segment and TV segments also backed the group revenue growing at 18 per cent and 20 per cent, respectively.
