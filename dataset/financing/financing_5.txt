President Maithripala Sirisena, the first Sri Lankan head of state to visit Malaysia in many years, received a rousing welcome at Putarjaya, the administrative capital of the South East Asian country.

On his arrival in Malaysia, the President received a guard of honour from the country’s security forces at the Kuala Lampur international airport.

The Sri Lankan President held discussions with top Malaysian authorities, including the country’s Prime Minister, on strengthening bilateral ties between the two countries.

The Sri Lankan government’s move to strengthen relations with Malaysia was a calculated one.

Malaysia, which suffered a massive economic tornado in the mid-90s, is well on the path to be a “High-Income Country” as defined by the World Bank (Gross National Income per capita above 12,615 USD, as of 2012).

Malaysia went from 6,700 USD per capita in 2009 to 10,060 USD per capita at the end of 2013.The rate of growth of private investments has seen a fivefold increase, speaking volumes for the rapid headway the country has made, on the economic development front.

Investments coming into Malaysia have exceeded expectations allowing to create 1.3 Million with a target of 3.3 Million to be created by 2020.

On the other hand, the Straits of Malacca which runs between Indonesia, Malaysia and Singapore, has long been a major gateway for trade to and from Asia, and is once again rapidly rising in importance.

Recently, it has served as the main transit route supplying vital commodities to Asia and other regions.

A report published in the World Economic Forum website stated that of the 87 million barrels of oil produced per day, approximately 15.2 million passed through the Straits of Malacca, the shortest sea route between African and Persian Gulf suppliers and Asian markets. This is some 19 times the amount that passed through the Panama Canal and four times more than the volume through the Suez Canal over the same period.
