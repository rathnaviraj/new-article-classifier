Nestlé, the world's leading nutrition, health and wellness company, has invested Rs 560 million in expanding its Malt Beverages line at the company's, long-established state-of-the-art manufacturing facility in Kurunegala where over 90% of Nestle's products in Sri Lanka are produced.
This investment is the first phase of a master plan for massive expansion and development in the country by Nestlé Lanka, where the company announced that, commencing 2011, Rs 10 billion would be invested in dairy development and manufacturing capacity expansion in the Beverages and Culinary areas over the next few years.
The new plant at Nestlé Lanka's manufacturing facility was inaugurated by Chamal Rajapaksa, Speaker of Sri Lanka Parliament, in the presence of Anura P. Yapa, Minister of Environment; Athula Wijesinghe, Chief Minister - North Western province; Pierre Schaufelberger, Vice President - Nestlé Zone AOA, Switzerland and Alois Hofbauer, Managing Director for Nestlé Lanka PLC.
Mr Schaufelberger said that Nestlé sees a lot of opportunity in Sri Lanka and believes in its potential. "Accordingly, we have stepped up our investment in the country. With our long term investment plans for Sri Lanka, we are taking a far-sighted view of business development to stimulate significant local development here."
Mr. Hofbauer noted that close to Rs 10 billion had been invested in the country by Nestlé so far, where close upon Rs 1.1 billion was invested in dairy development and capacity expansion in the company's Kurunegala factory in 2010. "This is approximately 5% of our 2010 sales and significantly higher compared to earlier years. In 2011, we will further accelerate our investment by doubling our commitment in these same areas to Rs 2 billion," he said, according to a Nestle statement issued at the end of the opening of the new plant.
