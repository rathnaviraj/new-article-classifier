The newly appointed Minister of Ports and Shipping Mahinda Samarasinghe said that any eventual agreement on the Hambantota Port should result in a win-win situation that the Government can market to the country as a good deal rather than a bad deal. In an interview with the Sunday Observer, Minister Samarasinghe said, it is not only a question of money, the Government has to ensure that our national interest is safeguarded.

He expressed optimism that the Government can negotiate these agreements leading to a mutually satisfactory outcome.

The Sri Lanka Ports Authority (SLPA) also has some concerns that need to be discussed further with the Chinese and the Minister hoped flexibility would be shown by both sides. The Minister categorically stated that the Government will not sell the Hambantota Port and it is only getting out of a very bad situation that was created by the previous Government.
