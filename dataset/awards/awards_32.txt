Suntel, whose majority stakes has been up for sale for several years, said this week it won a major award for being one of the best organisations to work for in Asia. In a press announcement, the company said it was declared winner of ‘Asia’s Dream Employer Award - Best Large Organisation to Work For’ at Asia Leadership Awards 2011 held in Dubai last week.
The award is judged on the quality of working relationships, trust and respect for staff, recognition of self-worth and career development, and honoured Suntel’s corporate culture as the best in Asia. 
In accepting the award at the Taj Palace Hotel Dubai, Sanjiv Wijayasinghe Director of Human Resources of Suntel, said ‘We are very pleased to be honoured and recognized for creating and maintaining a unique corporate culture that values people and their devotional contribution.”
The award was ironic for an organization where morale and motivation has dropped to low ebb ever since its major shareholders including Sweden’s Overseas Telecom AB 2007 decided to sell out. India’s MTNL, Dialog, Etisalat and Sri Lankan Telecom have been among those making bids that have however failed to materialize. While no staff has been laid off, workers have been encouraged to quit and in some cases long leave given a few months wages.
The Suntel press release on the award also quoted Jeremy Huxtable, its Managing Director as saying, “It is the people who make a difference in any business. We have undoubtedly done well in creating a strong and sustainable emotional bond not only among our own staff but also with the outside world.” 
The awards were organized by the Asian Confederation of Business and partnered by CMO Asia, CMO Council and the World HRD Congress, the Asian Leadership Awards and was said to recognise over 20 categories for their achievements and reward exemplary leadership in Asia’s post recession economic development.
