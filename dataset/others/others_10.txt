Vision Care which celebrated its 25th anniversary in February conducted a series of CSR activities to mark the occasion.
One such venture was the Nethralokana Sathkara project. Under this initiative 25,000 spectacles were distributed to deserving people in various parts of the island at zero cost. The recipients of the spectacles were chosen through an application process. Thereafter, the chosen applicants were given a comprehensive eye-test. The scheme was launched as mega events targeting the main cities of Galle, Kandy, Kurunegala, Jaffna and Colombo, with parallel program being held in the regional cities and branches around these main cities which strengthened the projects island-wide reach. The project which spanned over three months will culminate in a mega event at the Sri Lanka Exhibition and Convention Centre (SLECC) in Colombo this month.
