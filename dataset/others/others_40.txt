Fashion and lifestyle retailer ODEL recently donated garments and books to the Internally Displaced Persons in the North. The donation comprised 4,000 items of clothing for men, women and children and 7,900 exercise books of 80 and 120 pages, the company said.
“Clothing and books are two essential needs of people in the welfare villages and we hope our presentation of these items will be of immense value,” ODEL’s Founder and CEO Ms. Otara Gunewardene said. The donation was made through Habitat for Humanity Sri Lanka, a non governmental organization of which Ms. Gunewardene is to be appointed an Ambassador. Habitat will undertake distribution among the IDPs in Menik Farm and the Thoppigala area.
