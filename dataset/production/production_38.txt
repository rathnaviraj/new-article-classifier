Nokia introduced four new products, at the Progressing Together event held this week in Hanoi, that accelerate the company’s leadership in emerging markets.
Leading the pack is the Nokia 5000, which offers a 1.3 megapixel camera and a large QVGA display – Nokia’s first megapixel cameraphone at this price point – as well as music and email capabilities, each new product brings a balance of features, design and affordability to meet every lifestyle and budget. The new mobile devices are expected to begin shipping by the third quarter, with an expected price range between US$78 to US$140, before applicable taxes or subsidies, according to a Nokia statement.
In 2008, Nokia anticipates that for the first time, the number of replacement purchases in emerging markets will exceed those of first-time buyers.
“People in emerging markets like Vietnam are increasingly demanding more from their mobile phone – their expectations and demands in terms of functionality and design are similar to people in any other part of the world – with different income levels at their disposal,” says Chris Carr, Vice President, Sales, Southeast Asia & Pacific, who oversees Nokia’s business in this region.
“From the introduction of Nokia’s most affordable megapixel cameraphone, to a further expansion of our product range in this market segment, we believe today’s announcements demonstrate Nokia’s firm commitment to bringing products and services that serve the varied needs and tastes of people in emerging markets.”
