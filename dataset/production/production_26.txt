Sri Lankan IT company hSenid has signed on as “significant” sponsor for the international Telecom Application Development (TAD) Summit 2014, which will be held on November 12-13 in Istanbul, Turkey, wherein the local company will also share its success stories and even launch a new product, according Dinesh Saparamadu, the local firm’s Chief Executive Officer.

Elaborating further, Mr. Saparamadu added that “hSenid Mobile’s Telco Application Platform (TAP) is the fastest growing Telco grade API management platform in the region with some of the industry’s biggest deployments, hence it’s a natural progression for hSenid Mobile to be involved in TADs”.
Mr. Saparamadu also invited Sri Lankan entrepreneurs to attend the TAD Summit, saying: “Some of the winners of TAD Hack Sri Lanka held last June will be participating and they will get a chance to network with international mobile operators. It will be an opportunity for them to ‘Go Global’. This will also inspire more local developers to take to telco application development… Several local applications will be showcased this time including applications covering supply chain management, Cellular M2M use cases, Transport management, and Social Charity Application”.
Additionally, the following details about the event were also revealed: “TAD Summit is a forum, where all stake holders of the Telecom Application Development ecosystem come together and share knowledge, showcase their products and services and success stories. The Summit focuses on building an essential yet missing component of the telecom industry, that creates new services and customer value to address the revenue decline from the commoditisation of voice and messaging… The core objective is to showcase case studies of successful deployments of Telecom Applications, using the Telecom network assets like Messaging, Payments, In App Purchasing, Location, Web RTC, etc.”
