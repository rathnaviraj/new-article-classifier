Kelani Cables PLC recently launched its latest product, Kelani Tube Bulb which could be obtained in two and four feet sizes.
The introduction of CFL (Compact fluorescent Lamp) and GLS (General Lighting System) bulbs to the local market recently and the heavy demand those products have created motivated the company to introduce yet another innovative product, the company said in a statement.
Anil Munasinghe, General Manager (Sales and Marketing) of Kelani Cables PLC speaking at the launch ceremony of the new product, said the Kelani CFL bulb is significantly consolidating its position in the marketplace within a very short period.
“We have not received a single complaint with regard to Kelani Cables CFL bulb for the past six months. That is sheer proof of the durability and credibility of our product. It motivates us to add more innovative products to our CFL product range,” he said in comments released in a company media statement.
