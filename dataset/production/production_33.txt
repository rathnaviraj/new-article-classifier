Fonterra this week unveiled a special growing up milk powder, bringing a milk segment considered pivotal for toddlers within the consumer’s reach. When it comes to picking milk for toddlers, the international trend is clearly weighted on growing up milk powder, commonly known as GUMP, a fortified milk rich in DHA which is a nutrient that boosts brain development.
Even though GUMP dominates most of the milk powder markets in Asia, the market share in Sri Lanka for GUMP is a mere 2%; mostly due to high-prices and lack of awareness, the company said. 
The new product is called Anchor PediaPro which offers vital nutrients required for the most crucial stage of a child’s growth between the ages of 1 and 3.
The most notable ingredient is DHA, a nutrient identified by scientists as essential for mental development. “Anchor PediaPro contains the highest level of DHA among all GUMP in the market but at a much affordable price, filling a long-felt need in the market,” says Achyut Reddy, Managing Director of Fonterra Brands Lanka said in a press release.
