Day by day, the world is getting more connected as a result of globalisation. With the advancement of technology, brick and mortar banks are being replaced by online banking, the physical act of shopping has been replaced by online shopping websites. Due to the low transaction cost and convenience, more and more people are moving towards online shopping. Yet, it is not easy for an SME to enter into the e-commerce industry and establish themselves due to certain technical and financial restraints, it said.
Commenting on this, WebXpay.com Founder and CEO, Omar Sahib said “We provide an array of products and services to suit any business, especially the SMEs. Our offering ranges from creating basic websites or application complete e-commerce solution including a payment gateway to email-based online payments. We launched our services last month officially and have over 50 merchants signed up for various e-commerce solutions and have already started to use our services.”
In today’s context, getting a payment gateway from a bank is often a far-fetched notion for an SME due to the cost factor and other variable that result in non-eligibility. Even when an SME manages to secure a gateway, this is limited to specific card brands. Additionally getting a developer to build a website and thereafter maintain the site is a costly exercise. WebXpay.com was created with the purpose of expanding the online industry and enabling SME’s access to this key requirement, conveniently.
