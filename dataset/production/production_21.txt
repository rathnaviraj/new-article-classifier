Cathay Pacific Airways has launched its latest cargo product for the pharmaceutical industry in which temperature management throughout a journey is ensured the products arrive in perfect condition, the airline said.
Pharma LIFT ensures priority handling and a coordinated shipment process with multiple checkpoints throughout the journey. In Cathay Pacific’s Hong Kong hub, a dedicated Pharma LIFT team is assigned to look after every shipment. The warehouses used by the airline in Hong Kong are equipped with sophisticated, well-managed cool rooms maintained at specific temperatures, and most Cathay Pacific overseas stations are equipped with similar cool-room facilities, it said in a statement.
