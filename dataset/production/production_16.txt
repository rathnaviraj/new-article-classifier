Asian Alliance Insurance said this week it was introducing its “Click2Claim” Motor product that is expected to revolutionise motor insurance in the country.

With a simple Click2Claim, motor customers will be able to intimate their claims to Asian Alliance, avoid any inconvenience associated with an accident, and promptly be informed of their claim settlement.
“Asian Alliance Insurance is trailblazing a wave of innovation and technology that is expected to deliver widespread convenience to customers whilst improving processing speed and capacity that will set the platform for huge organisational efficiencies as the scope of business operations increases. Modern technology is enabling the delivery of simple and efficient solutions to customers and Click2Claim is one such product that is facilitated through the use of ever – growing smart phone usage,” according to a company statement.
Asian Alliance Motor customers will need to download the Click2Claim application on their smartphones that will be initiated when purchasing a motor policy, through a welcome call from Asian Alliance Insurance. The application automatically opens into the Call Centre number of Asian Alliance Insurance for intimating an accident. After intimating the accident, the customer logs in on his phone with his details and is directed to five mandatory clicks or photographs that need to be made. These include the driver’s licence, accident damage, a landmark nearby, photograph of driver and damage caused to the third party. On completing these Clicks, the customer sends these pictures to Asian Alliance Insurance, who will call back in minutes to confirm that they have the required details
