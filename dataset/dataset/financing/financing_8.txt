Jiffy Products S L (Pvt) Ltd is the Sri Lankan subsidiary of Jiffy International AS Kristiansand, Norway. Jiffy International AS is a transnational company which is engaged in manufacturing, sales and distribution of plant propagation substrate systems and related horticultural products globally.

Jiffy Products SL (Pvt) Ltd was incorporated in 2003 as a BOI project. The main attraction of Sri Lanka is the availability of coir fibre pith which is derived from coconut husks. This product has become increasingly popular all over the world as a medium to propagate and grow plants.

JPSL began its operations at the Mirigama Export Processing Zone as a BOI project and it has since then extended its operation to four locations of which two are in the Mirigama Export Processing Zone and the other two in Pannala and Kobeigane in the North Western Province.

JPSL is the leading manufacturer of Plant Propagation Coco Products in Sri Lanka. This project is very significant because it is a Norwegian investment. While Norway is not a member of the EU, it is closely associated as a member of the European Economic Area.

With growing interest of the European Union in Sri Lanka as a result of the return of the GSP+ facility products, such as those manufactured by this enterprise would become more competitive and therefore more attractive to consumers.
