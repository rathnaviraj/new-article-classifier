Consumer products multinational Unilever said on Thursday that it has acquired the Wonderlight trademark after the company, Wonderlight Consumer Products Ltd invited bids for the sale of its registered trademark.
Wonderlight, a popular brand in the washing soap and detergents category, had received many bids from which Unilever’s offer was accepted, according to a Unilever statement. “The sale is restricted to the purchase of the brand name only and does not include any assets or liabilities of the company. However in a separate development, Unilever Sri Lanka has agreed to purchase two soap powder packing machines from Wonderlight Consumer Products Ltd,” it said.
Wonderlight has said that difficulties faced in rising production costs and several other factors have made sustaining the growth of the brand untenable. The proceeds from the sale will be used to settle all creditors, provide adequate compensation for workers and to discharge all other dues, Unilever quoted that company as saying.
Surith Perera, Director, Home Care & Foods of Unilever Sri Lanka said Unilever will integrate this brand into its brand portfolio, with specific offerings for each consumer segment. Unilever Sri Lanka will endeavour to grow this much-loved Sri Lankan brand to its true potential, by using its marketing and distribution strengths to enable the Wonderlight brand to reach a significantly higher number of retail outlets. “For logistics reasons, the immediate focus is to manufacture and market the laundry soap, with the washing powder and scourers to follow,” Mr Perera said.
