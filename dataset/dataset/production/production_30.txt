Rainco (Pvt) Ltd, manufacturers of umbrellas providing the public protection against the sun or rain, is now moving into new areas of business akin to that. A fully owned subsidiary of Rainco, Meubel House and Light and Shade markets exclusive range of indoor blinds in bamboo, exterior blinds in PVC, and awnings and fabric canopies to meet the requirements of household and office interiors.
Fazal M Fausz, Managing Director, Rainco at a press conference this week said that their ventures have a three pronged vision of developing industries that would augment the economy of the country, solving the waste management issue and thereby becoming environmentally friendly.
Meubel House since its inception in 2003 managed to capture the market for designer, solid wood furniture. Mr Fausz said that they import furniture from Indonesia and market them here. They also have started manufacturing teak and mahogany furniture in Sr Lanka with specially treated wood.
Mr Fausz told Sunday Times FT that they are looking for unique products using innovations with existing craftsmanship in the country, modern technology and marketing techniques which could capture markets not only in Sri Lanka but globally. He said that in this regard they are discussing with Hewas Graphics(Pte) Ltd, manufacturers of a new kind of timber - Hewood Combi WPC which is made out of a combination of saw dust, paddy husk and recycled waste plastic. The product is stronger than timber of that thickness and unlike the natural timber, is waterproof.
Mr Fausz said that if the on-going discussions are successful, they would market this product and also explore the possibility of turning out furniture out of this material and which appear to be ideal to manufacture out door furniture.
He said that their products have been exported to countries like India, the UK, United States, Czech Republic and few other countries and once they master their new product profiles, they intend to make large scale exports.
