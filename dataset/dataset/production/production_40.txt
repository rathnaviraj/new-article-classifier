Commercial Bank of Ceylon announced this week a new product where customers can get an e-Passbook that provides access to details of savings, current, NRFC and RFC accounts on Android and iOS powered mobile devices.
The app, which updates automatically whenever the user is online, also stores the last view of the e-Passbook on the user’s mobile device, making it possible to view it even when the phone or tab is offline, the bank said in a media release.
“This is one of the most exciting new developments in our technology offering,” Commercial Bank Managing Director/CEO Jegan Durairatnam said. “This app is a great example of the bank’s capabilities in, and commitment to, technology-enabled banking.”
The e-Passbook is able to display account history as in a standard savings passbook or a current account statement. It offers users real-time tracking of account transactions of the last 30 days, and can be used as a single repository for multiple accounts enrolled by an account holder for the facility, with the capability to view each account separately.
