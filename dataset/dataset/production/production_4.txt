Seeking to meaningfully enhance lifestyles leveraging new technologies, HNB PLC, announced the launch of HNB FIT Savings Accounts, a product that enables customers to save more simply by exercising more.
The HNB FIT savings account essentially works by using fitness trackers to measure the number of steps a customer takes each day and based on how many steps they take, provide customers with a daily incentive on their basic interest rate of up to 10% per annum.
As a result, customers who are able to take over 6,000 steps a day will receive an incentive interest rate of 8% per annum for that day, while customers who take in excess of 10,000 steps will receive an outstanding interest rate of 10%.
“I’m sure many of us can relate to the difficulty of not just starting, but actually maintaining a regular exercise routine. Especially in today’s fast-paced, digitally-driven world, it is often difficult for us to strike a balance between our personal, professional and social lives. Yet it is precisely for that reason personal health and wellness takes on an increasingly important role. “With the launch of HNB FIT Savings Accounts, our goal is to help our customers to more easily achieve this balance by adding what we feel has been the missing ingredient – incentive. FIT stands for: Fitness, Interest and Technology. By merging these three ingredients, we have created a path for those who dedicate themselves to a target to immediately receive tangible benefits in the form of significantly increased savings.
In that regard we are confident that we can inspire and empower our customers to take control of their fitness and make their lifestyles work for them,” HNB Managing Director/CEO, Jonathan Alles said.
