Lanka Aluminium Industries PLC, pioneers in the manufacture of high quality powder coated aluminium extrusions, recently launched a Concept Centre in Colombo aimed at offering customers, architects and consultants information on innovative and latest aluminium extrusions.


Of the seven new products that were on display at the Concept Centre, the sliding folding system, sliding windows and doors specifically engineered for weather resistance incorporating integral water drain-outs, casement doors and the unique tilt and turn windows were keenly viewed by architects and consultants present at the launch, the company said in a media statement.
"The one drawback in the marketing of aluminium door and window systems is that the house builder - when shown individual pieces of aluminium - is unable to visualize what the finished product looks like. Hence, they are dependent on fabricators and designers to provide the necessary specifications. In addition, they very rarely have an idea of cost, and there is a tendency for certain unscrupulous elements to overcharge the house builder. "As a solution to these drawbacks and to provide a value-added service to the end user, Lanka Aluminium Industries PLC launched the Concept Centre displaying life size working models of windows and doors in attractive finishes," said Dinal Peiris - Managing Director, Lanka Aluminium Industries PLC, in the statement.
