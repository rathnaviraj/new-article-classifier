Global smartphone brand OPPO launched its first ever Selfie Expert F3 Plus at an event, held at the Hyatt Andaz, New Delhi in late March.
The company flew a team of reporters from Colombo for the launch where an all new feature, the “group selfie” resonating with increasing trend in selfies and advanced technical features for the amateur photographer, was profiled.
The Selfie Expert F3 Plus features the brand’s first dual front selfie camera including a first-ever 120-degree wide-angle Group Selfie Camera. The secret behind the ideal ‘group selfie’ is attributed to the specialized 120-degree wide-angle 8MP camera which captures a wider view, 105 per cent more than a regular 80-degree lens field of view. This feature allows more people to enter the frame with minimized lens distortion, thanks to the 6P camera lens. It also includes an eight-megapixel camera featuring a ¼-inch sensor.
OPPO’s latest addition to their smartphone range doesn’t merely cover sharp photography and the ‘selfie ’ experience, officials said at the launch. The Selfie Expert F3 Plus also OPPO’s signature beautification editing software, Beautify 4.0, a long lasting battery 4,000 mAh and a sleek, slim finish. The launch also introduced the brand’s New Brand Ambassador- actress Deepika Padukone and Indian photographer Dabboo Ratnani who shared their experiences with the picture perfect phone. (Purnima)
