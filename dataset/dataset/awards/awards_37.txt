The Brandix Group won 11 awards including the Exporter of the Year awards for 2014 and 2015 at the Presidential Export Awards, taking the top honours at this prestigious event conducted by the Export Development Board (EDB), the company said.  “The awards presented by President Maithripala Sirisena at the BMICH recognise the contribution of Brandix to the national economy as the country’s largest exporter overall, as the highest net foreign exchange earner in 2014 and 2015; the highest foreign exchange earner in the apparel sector in those two years; the highest employment provider in the export industry in 2014 and 2015 and the highest value added exporter in the apparel sector last year,” it said in a media release.

The two Exporter of the Year awards presented to the group this year confirm Brandix as Sri Lanka’s top exporter across all industries for the past four years. In all, the group has won 25 awards to date at the Presidential Export Awards.  “As a premier provider of inspired solutions to global apparel brands, we continue to focus on building value as we grow in size and capability,” Brandix CEO Ashroff Omar said. “While these awards reaffirm that we are on the right path, it is with due humility that we accept them for our contribution to Sri Lanka’s export earnings.”
