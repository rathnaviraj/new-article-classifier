Keells Food Products PLC recently won the Gold award in the Food and Beverages category at the 53rd Annual Report Awards competition organized by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Sri Lanka (CA Sri Lanka), while Ceylon Cold Stores PLC won the silver award.

Executive Vice President / CFO of Consumer Foods and Retail Sector, Sanjeewa Jayaweera said, “The fact that one of the two companies in the consumer food sector of the John Keells Group has now won the gold award for the past 11 years is an exceptional achievement and a reflection of how our committed team works throughout the year to make sure that our reports are always transparent, clear, cohesive, compliant and timely.”

Ceylon Cold Stores PLC, trading under the brand name ‘Elephant House’ is one of the oldest companies in Sri Lanka having commenced operations over 150 years ago. Its carbonated soft drinks range has over the years successfully competed with brands such as ‘Coca Cola’ and ‘Pepsi’ which are in the top 50 brands in the world. Elephant House is the market leader in the local ice cream market.

Venturing beyond the local market, CCS began its Maldivian operation in 2001 and has captured over half of the ice cream market.
