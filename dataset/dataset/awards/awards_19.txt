Pan Asia Bank Clinches the Excellence in Business and Financial Results award and Runner up award in the Banking Sector

Sri Lanka’s trail blazing fastest growing commercial bank, Pan Asia Bank was recognized with two coveted awards at the recently held National Business Excellence Awards (NBEA) 2016 organized by the National Chamber of Commerce, becoming the only mid size commercial bank to receive multiple awards in the ceremony.

Accordingly, Pan Asia Bank was adjudged as the overall winner in Excellence in Business and Financial Results category. This is an award category for which all the companies that took part in the selection process were considered. This award which is not confined to a particular sector recognizes areas such as growth in profitability, balance sheet and efficiency with which the business operates in.

The second accolade to be won by Pan Asia Bank was the Runner-up award in the banking sector under the extra large category. The fact that this award was won competing against much larger and older counterparts in the Sri Lankan banking industry highlights the superior growth story of Pan Asia Bank.

Commenting on the superlative achievements made by the bank within a relatively short time span, the bank’s Director/Chief Executive Officer, Dimantha Seneviratne attributed the robust growth and success of the bank to the untiring efforts of its staff to understand the and fulfill customer requirements and also to the strategic direction provided by the Chairman and the board of directors.

“If not for the correct guidance and support from the Board and our fellow team members who go that extra mile to delight our customers, this achievement would not have been possible.

I also extend my gratitude to all our customers who placed confidence on us which made this journey both exciting and rewarding throughout” said Seneviratne.
