HNB Grameen Finance Limited has been recognized as one of Sri Lanka’s best work places by Great Place to Work Institute Sri Lanka. The company managed to bag three accolades at this year’s awards ceremony held at Cinnamon Grand Colombo on 28 June.

Being adjudged for the first time since its inception, HNB Grameen was awarded ‘A Great Place to Work’, one of only 25 companies in Sri Lanka to be recognized as such this year, as well as the Bronze Medal in its respective category. HNB Grameen also received the coveted Special Award for Pride and Advocacy among its workforce.

Commenting on the achievement, B.M.D.C. Prabhath, Managing Director and CEO of HNB Grameen noted, “The value of this award to us, as a debutante to this accolade, is that we as an organization have not only achieved in terms of recognition among our customers but also our own people. It’s indeed a testament to the heart and soul that our staff, the lifeblood of HNB Grameen, has put in over the past 17 years. Having a significant and steadfast backing by two powerhouses in their respective industries - Hatton National Bank and Prime Lands Group - I believe this award has showcased the bond our people have not only with this company but also with what they do, interestingly, putting true weight behind who we are and our organizational mantra

The unique value of the Great Place to Work Certification is its unwavering ability to establish the true sentiment of an organization’s workforce. Conducted over a process involving a sampling of individuals, done independently by the team at Great Place to Work, including a Trust Index® Employee Survey and Culture Audit®, among others, the awards are meted out based solely on the unabated employee feedback.
