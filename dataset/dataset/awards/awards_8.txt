Hirdaramani repeated its previous year’s performance at the JASTECA Awards recently.

The awards are bestowed on companies on the basis of consistency and commendable levels of pursuing 5S principles.

The company topped the awards list for the second consecutive year. Sustaining its previous year’s performance, Hirdaramani bagged six awards at the event, including one Gold Award, one Silver Award, one Bronze Award, two Merit Awards and one Certificate of Compliance Award.

Hirdaramani’s performance demonstrates that the group continues to excel in its journey towards a leaner, more efficient, and therefore, a more responsible and sustainable manufacturer.

Director of Hirdaramani, Vinod Hirdaramani said, “Congratulations to the teams from all the factories for their exceptional performance.

“None of this would have been possible without JASTECA who have been championing the 5S methodology in Sri Lanka.”

“We are truly grateful to the team that has worked with us continuously over the years, sharing knowledge and advice and enabling us to truly reap the benefits of this methodology, going beyond a cleanliness tool to become a productivity tool.

“We are happy to be a part of driving this cultural change across our organizations and are grateful to JASTECA for their continued support and guidance. We look forward to developing our compliance further,” he said.

Topping the Jasteca awards winners list for another year, six Hirdaramani factories were selected for the final round of audits. The Group’s Eheliyagoda, Vavuniya and Seethawaka factories were rewarded for their continued excellence with Gold, Silver and Bronze awards.
