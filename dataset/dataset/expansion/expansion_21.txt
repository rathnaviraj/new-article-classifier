Serendib Technologies Asia (Pvt) Ltd., the official national representative and distributor of smartphone brand Mi, has recently announced the expansion of its existing portfolio with further products.

The company, in a media release, said it expected to officially debut five new Mi brand smartphone and powerbank models in the near future.

Xiaomi, often referred as the Apple of China, is the fifth largest smartphone company in the world, both in terms of shipments as well as market share. The Mi brand incorporates innovative technology, superior design and high quality user experience and is the top smartphone brand in India, and third largest in Russia and China.

Also, Xiaomi is the most popular and largest power-bank brand in the world.

Apart from smart phones and tablets, the ‘Mi Ecosystem ‘consists of Xiaomi branded smart gadgets, ranging from fitness bands, smart TVs and even household products such as air purifiers, induction heating pressure rice cookers and vacuum cleaners, the release said.

“It is always important to take note that you’re buying genuine products from the official distributor or an agent as fake Mi products are being sold by various resellers and websites in Sri Lanka which hardly offer any warranty, “said Keshan Fernando, Managing Director of Serendib Technologies Asia (Pvt) Ltd.
