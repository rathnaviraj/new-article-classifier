The insurance industry’s General Insurance gross premiums grew by a mere 2.27% year-on-year. This is from Rs. 18,134.34 million in 2016 and Rs. 18,545.26 million as at 1st Quarter 2017.

This growth reflects a 4% growth in the motor insurance class of business verses a 0.57% growth in the non motor class of business. This, the Chamber feels is a result of the industry functioning within an uneven playing field, due to the preference for State owned property and risks being granted exclusively to the State-owned insurers.

This has created an unhealthy situation to the industry’s growth and if the regulations and circulars providing undue advantages to State-owned insurers are removed, government institutions will have the opportunity of benefiting from a competitive service from the private sector companies, particularly with regard to premium prices and reinsurance security.

This will also result in the service levels of the State-owned companies to be more competitive and the service levels of the entire industry to improve, bringing about product diversification within the industry.
