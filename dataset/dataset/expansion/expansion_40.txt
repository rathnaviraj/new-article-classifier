Limoneira, the world’s largest lemon producer based in California in the US, has selected MTI Consulting to advise them on a major global expansion strategy that will target Europe, Latin America and Asia. Limoneira’s current strong hold on the North American market means that a global expansion strategy is likely to result in an even stronger grip on the world lemon market, according to an MTI press release.

Harold Edwards, President and CEO of Limoneira, had previously worked with MTI in his capacity as the CEO of Agribrands (across Asia, Europe, USA and Mexico). Mr. Edwards was impressed with MTI’s 8S Model, the consulting methodology and the calibre of the Consultants working across MTI’s expansive international operations, and accordingly has decided to retain MTI for this intensive international assignment, the statement said.

The Limoneira Company was founded in California in 1893 and has been responsible for the development of Sunkist Growers, Fruit Growers Supply and Diamond Walnut. Prime agricultural land throughout California has resulted in the company successfully developing over 7,000 acres for the agricultural production of lemons, avocados, oranges, specialty citrus, pistachios, pluots, and cherries. Since their inception in 1997, MTI has worked on assignments in 33 countries across Asia, the Middle East, Europe, North America and Australasia; offering bottom-line impacting solutions in Strategic Planning, Re-Structuring, Marketing and Supply Chain 
Management.
