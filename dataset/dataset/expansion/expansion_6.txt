Five prominent colonial business people got together in Prince Street in Pettah on February 25, 1839 and formed a Committee which later transformed into the Ceylon Chamber of Commerce. It was the Governor of Colonial Ceylon at that time, James Stewart-Mackenzie who was instrumental in setting up the Ceylon Chamber of Commerce with the aim of protecting the interests of the British business people.

The first Chairman was Joseph Read and the first Sri Lankan Chairman was S.T.L. De Soysa who became Chairman in 1959. The current Chairman of the Ceylon Chamber of Commerce is Samantha Ranatunga. “From 1839 until 1959 we have been having predominantly British people as Chairs of the Ceylon Chamber. It is steeped in that kind of British tradition and also why it is considered the most elite Chamber in the country. The recognition the Chamber has today has a lot to do with its history and where we started originally.”

At the initial stages the Chamber was focused on supporting business people and the export industry because the British had an export industry which consisted of tea, rubber and coconut. Ranatunga explains, “The Ceylon Chamber worked in a way where essentially people got together and looked at what could be done by way of infrastructure, by way of facilitation to trade which occurred between British colonies and the rest of the world. So if you take for instance the main road development from Colombo to Kandy, then the Colombo Port and then also the India - Sri Lanka trade routes, all those things took place as an initiative of the Chamber. The Chamber was very much a part of the legislative assembly and the legislation that was passed meant that it was facilitating the infrastructure to support the plantation economy. All of that took place with the auspices and influence of the Chamber.”
