Sri Lanka’s pioneer power solution company Assidua Technologies Pvt Ltd recently celebrated its 5th anniversary.
The company has reached great heights and received accolades of corporate sector in all spheres of power solutions in Sri Lanka for quality and excellence during five years of operations and also plans to further improve the success achieved so far by continuously introducing quality power solutions and related services in the future, a media release from the organisation said.
Assidua Technologies ended 2016 with excellent financial performance recording a 50 per cent increase in the company’s revenue generating record revenue of Rs. 300 million. In 2017, Assidua Technologies plans to further consolidate the growth momentum targeting a 25 per cent increase in its sales and profits.
Established in 2012, Assidua Technologies is a fully owned subsidiary of the Shan Group of Companies based in Dubai, a conglomerate established in 1999.
The group since then has made its presence felt across multiple continents in a remarkably short period of time including the United Arab Emirates (UAE), India, Nepal and Sri Lanka.
The company has also come forward with a new vision with Pradeep Bogahawatta joining the company as the Chief Executive Officer since last year. Mr. Bogahawatta brings with him over two decades of finance expertise and is one of the top professionals in the field today.
“The company which commenced its strong journey in 2012 as the sole accredited importer and distributor of Techfine, the premier brand for UPS (Uninterruptible Power Supply) devices and inverters, subsequently managed to join hands with US premier brand Emersion and many more dominant brands in the field of power solutions. The company has also been able to further consolidate its position in the market after being appointed as the sole accredited agent of China’s premium UPS brand Kstar,” the release added.
