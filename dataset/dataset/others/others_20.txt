Thousands of needy people in communities in many parts of Sri Lanka were benefited in 2009-10 from a series of Corporate Social Responsibility activities conducted by Ceylinco Life. These projects focused on the education, health and quality of life of residents of underprivileged areas in Sri Lanka, and comprised of multifaceted interventions, the company said in a statement.

The company also conducted its ‘Waidya Hamuwa’ free medical camps programme for the sixth consecutive year in 46 rural locations providing medical care to more than 12,000 people. Among the areas in which the medical camps were conducted were Dambulla, Nattandiya, Nochchiyagama, Anamaduwa, Moneragala, Kalawanchikudi and Akkaraipattu.
Commenting on the emphasis placed by the company on CSR activities, Ceylinco Life Deputy Chairman R Renganathan said: “We have one of the largest portfolios of community related activities in Sri Lanka’s corporate sector and our focus is predominantly on the poorest segments of the population.”
“As Sri Lanka’s largest life insurer, our involvement with the community is for the long term, and runs deep,” he said. “The benefits devolve across racial, religious and geographic boundaries.” The company also built water supply infrastructure for several villages. These projects involved restoring tanks, sinking wells and drilling tube wells facilities. Among the beneficiaries were the Nuffield School for the Deaf and Blind in Jaffna and the uda Oya Vidyalaya in Labukele.
