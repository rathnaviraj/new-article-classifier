Students of two rural schools whose classrooms were in temporary shelters have been provided purpose-built classroom buildings under Ceylinco Life’s on-going community initiative that supports disadvantaged schools around Sri Lanka.
A classroom each was donated to the Narawila Muslim Kanishta Vidyalaya in Koswatta in the Chilaw Educational Zone, and to the Sampur Sri Murugan Vidyalayam in Mutur, Trincomalee. Both schools teach children from grades one to five. The schools have eight teachers each, and 152 and 78 students respectively. These classroom buildings are the 69th and 70th classrooms donated by Ceylinco Life to date under the programme.
Ceylinco Life Managing Director and CEO R Renganathan said: “In many parts of our country, students undergo unimaginable hardships due to the lack of facilities in schools. This project helps create a more conducive environment for children endeavouring to study even under daunting circumstances and discomforts.”
The opening ceremonies for the classrooms were conducted with much enthusiasm by parents, teachers and students of both schools.
Ceylinco Life defines its Corporate Social Responsibility as ‘The continuing commitment of the company to create a sustainable business environment even in the remotest areas of the country through meaningful interventions in areas such as healthcare and education for needy people, while providing protection and financial security of the highest quality.’
