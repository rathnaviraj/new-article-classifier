A blood donation, organ donation registration, health clinic, eyeglass donation, school equipment donation for school children and donating dry rations for the poor - a CSR program of the Jeewa Foundation was held at the Sudharshi Hall, Colombo 7 recently.
A biography of Jeewa Foundation founder Concy Perera titled Rajinak Nowu Rajinak penned by Dr Asela S. Panditha too was launched at the event.
Concy Perera initiated Jeewa Foundation in 1985 with the slogan ‘We Become a Life to You.’
Perera was also felicitated with a doctorate from Russia on that day.
Perera has inherited the ability to feel for others in distress from her father F. D. Steven Perera. She says that though she was born to a family of eight, her home has been open to many poor children.
Thus she learnt to give and share at an early age. This habit soon snowballed as the years flew by. Today Perera has helped build many lives from scratch, providing financial aid for small scale businesses to donating building equipment for houses. She has also helped many release their lands from debt, donated sewing machines, helped to construct tube wells, providing various forms of relief to Tsunami and flood victims.
“I began by helping those close to me by donating dry rations and clothes. I soon realized that there are many others who are needy and underprivileged.
It was necessary to establish the foundation to help them and work towards a worthy cause on a broader scale,” she said.
