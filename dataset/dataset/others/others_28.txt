Pandanus Beach Resort and Spa was officially inaugurated by President Mahinda Rajapaksa at a glittering event with several local celebrities and performers graced the occasion with specially choreographed acts.
“A Russian aerial artist flown down by organisers Event Horizon captivated the audience with stunning performance from 20 feet above ground,” the organisers said.
The 96-room resort was developed on an investment of Rs 2 billion by newcomers to the hospitality industry Sunil Thilakawardhana of Thilakawardhana Textiles and Aruna De Silva of Evergreen Plantations. The hotel has a plush 2,500 square foot Presidential Suite, a 150 foot swimming pool, and a wellness spa by Ariana Spas. “Designed by architect Vinod Jayasinghe, the entire hotel is unique in that every guest area faces the sea,” the organisers said.
