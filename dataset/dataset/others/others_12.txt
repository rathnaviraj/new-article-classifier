The Brandix Group accelerated its ‘model village’ program last year to help communities around its factories with water supply and sanitation needs.
The Group completed multiple projects at schools, hospitals, places of worship, police stations and a community centre last year, committing more resources and time to a program that is at the heart of the Group’s community relations agenda, a Group spokesman said.
“The simultaneous participation of 12 factories in our model village program enabled us to reach out and help thousands of people in different parts of the country last year,” said Head of CSR and Corporate Communications of the Brandix Group, Anusha Alles.
“Inadequate water supply and sanitation facilities continue to be a problem at many public institutions even in some urban and suburban areas, and we had to expand the program to reach needy communities sooner rather than later,” she said.
Inspired by the temple, school and tank–centred village development concept of yore, the Brandix program identifies and addresses water-related issues facing people resident within a five-kilometre radius of the Group’s factories in its first phase, and thereafter, extends its assistance to an area within a 10-kilometre radius of the factories to benefit more people in the program’s second phase.
Communities helped last year were those within five kilometres of the Brandix factories in Ekala, Katunayake, Seeduwa, Batticaloa, Kahawatte, Koggala, Rambukkana, Avissawella, Welisara, Ratmalana and Nittambuwa, and those within five to ten kilometres of the Brandix factory at Nivithigala.
