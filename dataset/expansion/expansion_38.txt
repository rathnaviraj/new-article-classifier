Visits by three top management representatives of American & Efird Inc. (A&E) have laid the groundwork for a new phase of expansion for A&E Lanka (Pvt) Ltd., the Brandix Lanka subsidiary manufacturing world class sewing and embroidery thread, the company said.

The visits within the past five months by Messrs Fred A. Jackson – President, John Leslie Miller – Executive Vice President – Sales and Operations and Robert Hallett – Vice President International Operations at American & Efird Inc. were primarily to evaluate potential for expansion of A&E’s operations in Sri Lanka to cater to increasing demand and new opportunities in the market, it said in a statement.

“The resurgence of the apparel sector and anticipated further strengthening presents possibilities and challenges for A&E Lanka,” Janaka Gamage, CEO of A&E Lanka said. “The three visits to provide expert guidance to leverage these opportunities to their potential underlined the commitment of A&E to its local operations. This also enabled the parent company to assess firsthand the readiness of the operation to keep pace with the latest developments in the industry.”

American & Efird Lanka (Pvt) Ltd. is a joint venture partnership between American & Efird Inc. USA, one of the world’s premier Industrial Sewing Thread Suppliers; Brandix Lanka Ltd, Sri Lanka’s single largest apparel exporter and Brandot International Ltd., USA.
