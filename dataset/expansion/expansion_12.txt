Over the past 50 years, the biggest achievement was taking one small shop and transforming it into a diversified conglomerate, Group Managing Director, Sunshine Holdings, Vish Govindasamy said in an interview with the Sunday Observer.

Going down memory lane, he said that Sunshine Holdings PLC, one of the leading conglomerates in Sri Lanka was set up 50 years ago as a single pharmacy store by G. Sathasivam. It was then known as Lanka Medical (Pvt) Ltd and was situated in Gampola.

The business grew rapidly during its first ten years of operation and became the sole agent for the State Pharmaceutical Corporation for the upcountry area.

In 1977, they opened a ‘super center’ type of store in Kandy (Lanka Medicals Kandy) - where people could buy pharmaceutical products, home appliances, food items and cosmetics under one roof. It was the first of its kind in Sri Lanka at that time.

Then the founders moved to Colombo. They tied up with several partners which became agents at present. It also tied up with local and Indian agencies to facilitate a successful island-wide pharmaceutical distribution

Today, Sunshine Healthcare retains a substantial20% share of the private healthcare market, supplying over a thousand pharmaceuticals, nutraceuticals, medical diagnostic equipment and surgical products to over two thousand pharmacies, clinics and hospitals across Sri Lanka.
